# The Purpose
This repo includes CSS & SCSS styling that you can apply to your theme which allows you to warn the user. This can be useful in situations such as warning the user for being in the wrong theme mode, or notifying the user of something important.

It should be noted that these are not dismissable since they are made purely from CSS. In a nutshell, you should probably not use something like this unless you absolutely have to.

# Styles
You can find both CSS & SCSS styling in the folders. It is suggested that you look through the styling and change it to your liking.

More styles may be added in the future. If you have a suggestion, feel free to make an issue on this repo or join my [support server](https://discord.gg/vYdXbEzqDs) and suggest them there.

## Notice
Shows a notice banner that is native to Discord's notice banners.

## Notification
Shows a notification at the bottom right. If you want this notice to show in a different location, you have to change the positioning values. There are two separate style types: information and warning.
